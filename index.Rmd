# Presentation Overview

- Background on graphical models and differential networks

- Overview of statistical landscape for differential network analysis

- Overview of available software

- Links to practical application using a few software options

- Discussion & feedback!

???
- My goal is to give you an overview of the statistical and software landscape, as well as a few applied examples. 

- I'm working on a writing a full tutorial geared toward helping applied researchers implement these methods - I look forward to your feedback! 

# Motivation

- Identifying networks in biomedical data, and how they differ across populations, can help find drivers of disease and targets for treatment

```{r out.width = '75%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("difnet_overview.png")
```

- Certain biomedical research questions lend themselves well to network/pathway analysis

    - Data from brain scans (Alzheimer's patient scans over time)
    - Gene expression (cancer vs normal tissue)
    - Microbiome (Crohn's disease vs Healthy Control)
    - Metabolomics - any applications from the group here?

# Background: Graphical Model

- Graphical models express connections between variables. When undirected, the connection doesn't imply any directionality.

```{r out.width = '70%', echo = FALSE}
#![](UMass.png)
knitr::include_graphics("graph.png")

```


- Connected edges can be seen in an **Adjacency Matrix**, where anything with a zero is considered "conditionally independent", and anything with a 1 is considered "conditionally dependent"

- In this example, A and B are **conditionally independent** of D


---

# Gaussian Graphical Model

- Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) are the most widely used probabilistic graphical models (See Kate Shutta's recently published tutorial on GGMs for full details! `r Cite(bib, "shutta_balasubramanian_tutorial")`)

- Assume data $\mathbf{y}$ is distributed as multivariate Gaussian $N(\mu, \Sigma)$ with mean vector $\mathbf{\mu}$ and precision matrix $\Sigma^{-1} = \Omega$ whose entries correspond to partial correlation between variables

- So any two entries are conditionally independent if entry in $\Omega$ is zero. 

- In low dimensional setting, the Likelihood function:

  $$l(\Omega; S) = ln|\Omega| - tr(S\Omega)$$

- Where $\Omega = \Sigma^{-1}$ is the "precision matrix" and $S$ is sample covariance matrix. 

- We want an estimate for this which we will call $P = S^{-1}$. This will give us the graph structure.

---

# More than one graphical model

- Say you have data from two groups, like disease and healthy control.

- Say you estimate a graphical model for each group, then want to compare the resulting networks.


```{r out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
#![](UMass.png)
knitr::include_graphics("diffnet.png")

```

---

# But are the networks different??

- How do you estimate them?

- How do you test the difference? 

- How do you even *characterize* the difference? (edges? nodes? hubs? general structure?)

- This all falls under DIFFERENTIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS! (DiNA)

```{r out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
#![](UMass.png)
knitr::include_graphics("diffnet.png")

```

```{r child='02_stats_overview.Rmd'}
```

```{r child='03_software.Rmd'}
```
--- 
# Takeaways

- DiNA has potential to be a useful tool in biomedical research 

- There are many ways to customize the estimation and testing process to fit research question and data types

- However the broad landscape of methods and software and the current lack of practical applied tutorials comparing software methods seems like a barrier to widespread use

- I'm working on trying to bridge the gap between statistical methodology and applied researchers! Full tutorial forthcoming!

# R tools used in analysis

* [spikeyglass](https://mljaniczek.github.io/spikeyglass/) for running SSJGL
* [igraph](https://igraph.org/): for plotting network graphs  
* [JGL](https://cran.r-project.org/package=JGL): for running JGL 
* [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/): for data wrangling   
* [RColorBrewer](https://cran.r-project.org/package=RColorBrewer): for pretty color palettes
* pheatmap: My favorite heatmap package, makes the heatmaps with annotated tracks
(See this [blog post](https://davetang.org/muse/2018/05/15/making-a-heatmap-in-r-with-the-pheatmap-package/) by Dave Tang for a nice tutorial on using this package.)
* Slides created via the R package [**xaringan**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).
