# Software Landscape of DiNA methods

# Overview DiNA software landscape

- I found 26 different R packages and 2 Python packages that implement a variety of subtly different DiNA algorithms/pipelines

# Notes on software

- `JGL`, `iDingo`, `rags2ridges`, and `SpiecEasy` seem to be most popular and cited.

- I have a full tutorial for `JGL` posted on my [GitHub](https://mljaniczek.github.io/jgl-tutorial/), and Kate has one available for `iDingo`. 

- Currently working making tutorials for for `rags2ridges`, `Spiec-Easy` and will work through the other available methods

# Placeholder for JGL example

- JGL package runs Fused Graphical Lasso (FGL) and Group Graphical Lasso from Danaher et al 2014

- Estimates sparse covariance matrices that are *similar* across classes

- Has a lot of useful functions to analyze the networks after estimating them, for example extracting hubs, edges, degree etc. 

- Graphical lasso uses L1 penalty, which encourages sparsity and as a result selects edges in the graph in the process of estimating precision matrix

---
# Placeholder for rags2ridges example

- `rags2ridges` is great for p >>> n settings. Uses L2-penalized estimation of precision matrices

- Useful when classes are believed to share most of the same structure

- Graphical ridge uses L2 penalty which doesn't shrink things down to zero, so you select edges AFTER estimating the precision matrix. Can be useful if there's a lot of colinearity 

- As a side note this package is nicely written with some fun easter eggs hidden in

# Questions for the group

- What do you find helpful in a tutorial or when identifying methods to use? 

- I propose to both use simulated data (under various conditions referenced above) and several real-world datasets with all the software.
