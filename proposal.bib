In this paper, we consider the problem of detecting differential substructure between two nonparanormal graphical models with false discovery rate control. We construct a new statistic based on a truncated estimator of the unknown transformation functions, together with a bias-corrected sample covariance. Furthermore, we show that the new test statistic converges to the same distribution as its oracle counterpart does. Both synthetic data and real cancer genomic data are used to illustrate the promise of the new method. Our proposed testing framework is simple and scalable, facilitating its applications to large-scale data.

Motivated by modern applications, this manuscript considers an extended setting where each group is generated by a latent variable Gaussian graphical model. Due to the existence of latent factors, the differential network is decomposed into sparse and low-rank components, both of which are symmetric indefinite matrices. We estimate these two components simultaneously using a two-stage procedure: (i) an initialization stage, which computes a simple, consistent estimator, and (ii) a convergence stage, implemented using a projected alternating gradient descent algorithm applied to a nonconvex objective, initialized using the output of the first stage. We prove that given the initialization, the estimator converges linearly with a nontrivial, minimax optimal statistical error. Experiments on synthetic and real data illustrate that the proposed nonconvex procedure outperforms existing methods.},

	abstract = {Identifying differences in networks has become a canonical problem in many biological applications. Here, we focus on testing whether two Gaussian graphical models are the same. Existing methods try to accomplish this goal by either directly comparing their estimated structures, or testing the null hypothesis that the partial correlation matrices are equal. However, estimation approaches do not provide measures of uncertainty, e.g., \$p\$-values, which are crucial in drawing scientific conclusions. On the other hand, existing testing approaches could lead to misleading results in some cases. To address these shortcomings, we propose a qualitative hypothesis testing framework, which tests whether the connectivity patterns in the two networks are the same. Our framework is especially appropriate if the goal is to identify nodes or edges that are differentially connected. No existing approach could test such hypotheses and provide corresponding measures of uncertainty, e.g., \$p\$-values. We investigate theoretical and numerical properties of our proposal and illustrate its utility in biological applications. Theoretically, we show that under appropriate conditions, our proposal correctly controls the type-I error rate in testing the qualitative hypothesis. Empirically, we demonstrate the performance of our proposal using simulation datasets and applications in cancer genetics and brain imaging studies.},

	abstract = {High-throughput microbial sequencing techniques, such as targeted amplicon-based and metagenomic profiling, provide low-cost genomic survey data of microbial communities in their natural environment, ranging from marine ecosystems to host-associated habitats. While standard microbiome profiling data can provide sparse relative abundances of operational taxonomic units or genes, recent advances in experimental protocols give a more quantitative picture of microbial communities by pairing sequencing-based techniques with orthogonal measurements of microbial cell counts from the same sample. These tandem measurements provide absolute microbial count data albeit with a large excess of zeros due to limited sequencing depth. In this contribution we consider the fundamental statistical problem of estimating correlations and partial correlations from such quantitative microbiome data. To this end, we propose a semi-parametric rank-based approach to correlation estimation that can naturally deal with the excess zeros in the data. Combining this estimator with sparse graphical modeling techniques leads to the Semi-Parametric Rank-based approach for {INference} in Graphical model ({SPRING}). {SPRING} enables inference of statistical microbial association networks from quantitative microbiome data which can serve as high-level statistical summary of the underlying microbial ecosystem and can provide testable hypotheses for functional species-species interactions. Due to the absence of verified microbial associations we also introduce a novel quantitative microbiome data generation mechanism which mimics empirical marginal distributions of measured count data while simultaneously allowing user-specified dependencies among the variables. {SPRING} shows superior network recovery performance on a wide range of realistic benchmark problems with varying network topologies and is robust to misspecifications of the total cell count estimate. To highlight {SPRING}'s broad applicability we infer taxon-taxon associations from the American Gut Project data and genus-genus associations from a recent quantitative gut microbiome dataset. We believe that, as quantitative microbiome profiling data will become increasingly available, the semi-parametric estimators for correlation and partial correlation estimation introduced here provide an important tool for reliable statistical analysis of quantitative microbiome data.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btab502},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Differential network analysis is an important tool to investigate the rewiring of gene interactions under different conditions. Several computational methods have been developed to estimate differential networks from gene expression data, but most of them do not consider that gene network rewiring may be driven by the differential expression of individual genes. New differential network analysis methods that simultaneously take account of the changes in gene interactions and changes in expression levels are needed.
{RESULTS}: In this paper, we propose a differential network analysis method that considers the differential expression of individual genes when identifying differential edges. First, two hypothesis test statistics are used to quantify changes in partial correlations between gene pairs and changes in expression levels for individual genes. Then, an optimization framework is proposed to combine the two test statistics so that the resulting differential network has a hierarchical property, where a differential edge can be considered only if at least one of the two involved genes is differentially expressed. Simulation results indicate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. We apply our method to identify the differential networks between the luminal A and basal-like subtypes of breast cancer and those between acute myeloid leukemia and normal samples. Hub nodes in the differential networks estimated by our method, including both differentially and non-differentially expressed genes, have important biological functions.

We learn which sample groups have a shared graph structure by placing a spike-and-slab prior on the parameters that measure network relatedness. This approach allows us to share information between sample groups, when appropriate, as well as to obtain a measure of relative network similarity across groups. Our modeling framework incorporates relevant prior knowledge through an edge-specific informative prior and can encourage similarity to an established network. Through simulations, we demonstrate the utility of our method in summarizing relative network similarity and compare its performance against related methods.

In many applications, data are naturally regarded as a vector of random functions rather than as a vector of scalars. For example, electroencephalography ({EEG}) data are treated more appropriately as functions of time. In such a problem, not only can the number of functions measured per sample be large, but each function is itself an infinite dimensional object, making estimation of model parameters challenging. This is further complicated by the fact that curves are usually observed only at discrete time points. We first define a functional differential graph that captures the differences between two functional graphical models and formally characterize when the functional differential graph is well defined. We then propose a method, {FuDGE}, that directly estimates the functional differential graph without first estimating each individual graph. This is particularly beneficial in settings where the individual graphs are dense but the differential graph is sparse. We show that {FuDGE} consistently estimates the functional differential graph even in a high-dimensional setting for both fully observed and discretely observed function paths. We illustrate the finite sample properties of our method through simulation studies. We also propose a competing method, the Joint Functional Graphical Lasso, which generalizes the Joint Graphical Lasso to the functional setting. Finally, we apply our method to {EEG} data to uncover differences in functional brain connectivity between a group of individuals with alcohol use disorder and a control group.},

This corresponds to a simple model for the mechanism underlying many cancers, in which the gene regulatory network is disrupted due to the aberrant activity of a few specific genes. We propose to solve this problem using the perturbed-node joint graphical lasso, a convex optimization problem that is based upon the use of a row-column overlap norm penalty.

The analysis of such metabolic association networks can reveal differences in the underlying biological reactions caused by cadmium exposure. We consider Bayesian inference and propose using the multiplicative (or Chung–Lu random graph) model as a prior on the graphical space. In the multiplicative model, each edge is chosen independently with probability equal to the product of the connectivities of the end nodes. This class of prior is parsimonious yet highly flexible; it can be used to encourage sparsity or graphs with a pre-specified degree distribution when such prior knowledge is available. We extend the multiplicative model to multiple {GGMs} linking the probability of edge inclusion through logistic regression and demonstrate how this leads to joint inference for multiple {GGMs}.

	abstract = {Reconstructing gene networks from gene expression data is a long-standing challenge. In most applications, the observations can be divided into several distinct but related subpopulations and the gene expression measurements can be collected from multiple data types. Most existing methods are designed to estimate a single gene network from a single dataset. These methods may be suboptimal since they do not exploit the similarities and differences among different subpopulations and data types. In this article, we propose a joint graphical model to estimate the multiple gene networks simultaneously. Our model decomposes each subpopulation-specific gene network as a sum of common and unique components and imposes a group lasso penalty on gene networks corresponding to different data types. The gene network variations across subpopulations can be learned automatically by the decompositions of networks, and the similarities and differences among data types can be captured by the group lasso penalty. The simulation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We also apply our method to the cancer genome atlas breast cancer datasets to reconstruct subtype-specific gene networks. Hub nodes in the estimated subnetworks unique to individual cancer subtypes rediscover well-known genes associated with breast cancer subtypes and provide interesting predictions.},

In this paper we develop an estimator for such models appropriate for data from several graphical models that share the same variables and some of the dependence structure. In this setting, estimating a single graphical model would mask the underlying heterogeneity, while estimating separate models for each category does not take advantage of the common structure. We propose a method that jointly estimates the graphical models corresponding to the different categories present in the data, aiming to preserve the common structure, while allowing for differences between the categories. This is achieved through a hierarchical penalty that targets the removal of common zeros in the inverse covariance matrices across categories. We establish the asymptotic consistency and sparsity of the proposed estimator in the high-dimensional case, and illustrate its performance on a number of simulated networks.

For a fixed graph of interest, we demonstrate that accounting for graph structure can yield more powerful tests under the assumption of smooth distribution shift on the graph. We also investigate the identification of nonhomogeneous subgraphs of a given large graph, which poses both computational and multiple hypothesis testing problems.

Correlation approaches, such as a hierarchical cluster analysis, have been widely used to analyze omics data. In addition to the changes in the mean levels of molecules in the omics data, it is important to know about the changes in the correlation relationship among molecules between 2 experimental conditions. The development of a tool to identify differential correlation patterns in omics data in an efficient and unbiased manner is therefore desirable. We developed the {DiffCorr} package, a simple method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental conditions in correlation networks, which builds on a commonly used association measure, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient. {DiffCorr} calculates correlation matrices for each dataset, identifies the first principal component-based "eigen-molecules" in the correlation networks, and tests differential correlation between the 2 groups based on Fisher's z-test. We illustrated its utility by demonstrating biologically relevant, differentially correlated molecules in transcriptome coexpression and metabolite-to-metabolite correlation networks. {DiffCorr} can explore differential correlations between 2 conditions in the context of post-genomics data types, namely transcriptomics and metabolomics. {DiffCorr} is simple to use in calculating differential correlations and is suitable for the first step towards inferring causal relationships and detecting biomarker candidates.

This situation arises, for example, when protein activation on a certain pathway is recorded, and a subgroup of patients is characterized by a pathological disruption of that pathway. A similar situation arises when one subgroup of patients is treated with a drug that targets that same pathway. In both cases, understanding changes in the joint distribution and dependence structure across the two subgroups is key to the desired inference. Fitting a single model for the entire data could mask the differences. Separate independent analyses, on the other hand, could reduce the effective sample size and ignore the common features. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian graphical model that addresses heterogeneity and implements borrowing of strength across the two subgroups by simultaneously centering the prior towards a global network. The key feature is a hierarchical prior for graphs that borrows strength across edges, resulting in a comparison of pathways across subpopulations (differential pathways) under a unified model-based framework. We apply the proposed model to data sets from two very different studies: histone modifications from {ChIP}-seq experiments, and protein measurements based on tissue microarrays.},

To compare two or more networks simultaneously, we developed {BioNetStat}, a Bioconductor package with a user-friendly graphical interface. {BioNetStat} compares correlation networks based on the probability distribution of a feature of the graph (e.g., centrality measures). The analysis of the structural alterations on the network reveals significant modifications in the system. For example, the analysis of centrality measures provides information about how the relevance of the nodes changes among the biological states. We evaluated the performance of {BioNetStat} in both, toy models and two case studies. The latter related to gene expression of tumor cells and plant metabolism. Results based on simulated scenarios suggest that the statistical power of {BioNetStat} is less sensitive to the increase of the number of networks than Gene Set Coexpression Analysis ({GSCA}).

Differential Network Analysis ({DiNA}) examines different biological processes based on gene regulatory networks that represent regulatory interactions between genes with a graph model. While most studies in {DiNA} have considered correlation-based inference to construct gene regulatory networks from gene expression data due to its intuitive representation and simple implementation, the approach lacks in the representation of causal effects and multivariate effects between genes. In this paper, we propose an approach named Differential Gene Regulatory Network ({DiffGRN}) that infers differential gene regulation between two groups. We infer gene regulatory networks of two groups using Random {LASSO}, and then we identify differential gene regulations by the proposed significance test. The advantages of {DiffGRN} are to capture multivariate effects of genes that regulate a gene simultaneously, to identify causality of gene regulations, and to discover differential gene regulators between regression-based gene regulatory networks. We assessed {DiffGRN} by simulation experiments and showed its outstanding performance than the current state-of-the-art correlation-based method, {DINGO}. {DiffGRN} is applied to gene expression data in asthma.

In contrast to conventional differential analysis, {DiNA} identifies changes in the interplay between molecules, rather than changes in single molecules. This ability is especially important in cases where effectors are changed, e.g. mutated, but their expression is not. A number of different {DiNA} approaches have been proposed, yet a comparative assessment of their performance in different settings is still lacking. In this paper, we evaluate 10 different {DiNA} algorithms regarding their ability to recover genetic key players from transcriptome data. We construct high-quality regulatory networks and enrich them with co-expression data from four different types of cancer. Next, we assess the results of applying {DiNA} algorithms on these data sets using a gold standard list ({GSL}). We find that local {DiNA} algorithms are generally superior to global algorithms, and that all {DiNA} algorithms outperform conventional differential expression analysis. We also assess the ability of {DiNA} methods to exploit additional knowledge in the underlying cellular networks. To this end, we enrich the cancer-type specific networks with known regulatory {miRNAs} and compare the algorithms performance in networks with and without {miRNA}. We find that including {miRNAs} consistently and considerably improves the performance of almost all tested algorithms.

The delineation of these components allows for a more refined picture of the major driver and passenger events in the elucidation of cancer progression and development.Results: Simulation studies demonstrate that {DINGO} provides more accurate group-specific conditional dependencies than achieved by using separate estimation approaches.

For testing equality of covariance matrices of a set of features, many methods have been limited to the two‐sample problem and involve varying assumptions on the number of features p versus the sample size n. More general covariance regression approaches are appealing but have been insufficiently structured to provide interpretable testing. To address these deficiencies, we propose a simple uniform framework to test association of covariance matrices with an experimental variable, whether discrete or continuous. We describe four different summary statistics, to ensure power and flexibility under various alternatives, including a new “connectivity” statistic that is sensitive to the changes in overall covariance magnitude. For continuous experimental variables, a natural individual “risk score” is associated with several of the statistics. We establish asymptotic results applicable to both continuous and discrete responses, with relatively mild conditions and allowing for situations where p{\textgreater}n. We also show that the proposed statistics are permutationally equivalent to some existing methods in the two‐sample special case. We demonstrate the power and utility of our approaches via simulation and analysis of real data. The R package {CorDiff} is published on R {CRAN}.},

Knowledge extraction from cancer genomic studies is continuously challenged by the fast-growing technological advances generating high-dimensional data. Network science is a promising discipline to cope with the resulting complex and heterogeneous datasets, enabling the disclosure of the molecular networks involved in cancer development and progression. We present a narrative review of the network-based strategies that have been applied to glioblastoma ({GBM}), a complex and heterogeneous disease, along with a discussion on the relevant findings and open challenges and future research opportunities.

Abstract
Network science has long been recognized as a well-established discipline across many biological domains. In the particular case of cancer genomics, network discovery is challenged by the multitude of available high-dimensional heterogeneous views of data. Glioblastoma ({GBM}) is an example of such a complex and heterogeneous disease that can be tackled by network science. Identifying the architecture of molecular {GBM} networks is essential to understanding the information flow and better informing drug development and pre-clinical studies. Here, we review network-based strategies that have been used in the study of {GBM}, along with the available software implementations for reproducibility and further testing on newly coming datasets. Promising results have been obtained from both bulk and single-cell {GBM} data, placing network discovery at the forefront of developing a molecularly-informed-based personalized medicine.},

	abstract = {Motivation
Differential network analysis is an important way to understand network rewiring involved in disease progression and development. Building differential networks from multiple ‘omics data provides insight into the holistic differences of the interactive system under different patient-specific groups. {DINGO} was developed to infer group-specific dependencies and build differential networks. However, {DINGO} and other existing tools are limited to analyze data arising from a single platform, and modeling each of the multiple ‘omics data independently does not account for the hierarchical structure of the data.

Results
We developed the {iDINGO} R package to estimate group-specific dependencies and make inferences on the integrative differential networks, considering the biological hierarchy among the platforms. A Shiny application has also been developed to facilitate easier analysis and visualization of results, including integrative differential networks and hub gene identification across platforms.

This emergent analytical toolset frequently ports over techniques developed in other multi-omics investigations, especially the growing array of statistical and computational techniques for integrating and representing data through networks. While network analysis has emerged as a powerful approach to modeling microbiome data, oftentimes by integrating these data with other types of omics data to discern their functional linkages, it is not always evident if the statistical details of the approach being applied are consistent with the assumptions of microbiome data or how they impact data interpretation. In this review, we overview some of the most important network methods for integrative analysis, with an emphasis on methods that have been applied or have great potential to be applied to the analysis of multi-omics integration of microbiome data. We compare advantages and disadvantages of various statistical tools, assess their applicability to microbiome data, and discuss their biological interpretability.

	abstract = {Genes often work together to perform complex biological processes, and "networks" provide a versatile framework for representing the interactions between multiple genes. Differential network analysis ({DiNA}) quantifies how this network structure differs between two or more groups/phenotypes (e.g., disease subjects and healthy controls), with the goal of determining whether differences in network structure can help explain differences between phenotypes. In this paper, we focus on gene co-expression networks, although in principle, the methods studied can be used for {DiNA} for other types of features (e.g., metabolome, epigenome, microbiome, proteome, etc.). Three common applications of {DiNA} involve (1) testing whether the connections to a single gene differ between groups, (2) testing whether the connection between a pair of genes differs between groups, or (3) testing whether the connections within a "module" (a subset of 3 or more genes) differs between groups. This article focuses on the latter, as there is a lack of studies comparing statistical methods for identifying differentially co-expressed modules ({DCMs}). Through extensive simulations, we compare several previously proposed test statistics and a new p-norm difference test ({PND}). We demonstrate that the true positive rate of the proposed {PND} test is competitive with and often higher than the other methods, while controlling the false positive rate. The R package {discoMod} (differentially co-expressed modules) implements the proposed method and provides a full pipeline for identifying {DCMs}: clustering tools to derive gene modules, tests to identify {DCMs}, and methods for visualizing the results.},

	abstract = {16S ribosomal {RNA} ({rRNA}) gene and other environmental sequencing techniques provide snapshots of microbial communities, revealing phylogeny and the abundances of microbial populations across diverse ecosystems. While changes in microbial community structure are demonstrably associated with certain environmental conditions (from metabolic and immunological health in mammals to ecological stability in soils and oceans), identification of underlying mechanisms requires new statistical tools, as these datasets present several technical challenges. First, the abundances of microbial operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) from amplicon-based datasets are compositional. Counts are normalized to the total number of counts in the sample. Thus, microbial abundances are not independent, and traditional statistical metrics (e.g., correlation) for the detection of {OTU}-{OTU} relationships can lead to spurious results. Secondly, microbial sequencing-based studies typically measure hundreds of {OTUs} on only tens to hundreds of samples; thus, inference of {OTU}-{OTU} association networks is severely under-powered, and additional information (or assumptions) are required for accurate inference. Here, we present {SPIEC}-{EASI} ({SParse} {InversE} Covariance Estimation for Ecological Association Inference), a statistical method for the inference of microbial ecological networks from amplicon sequencing datasets that addresses both of these issues. {SPIEC}-{EASI} combines data transformations developed for compositional data analysis with a graphical model inference framework that assumes the underlying ecological association network is sparse. To reconstruct the network, {SPIEC}-{EASI} relies on algorithms for sparse neighborhood and inverse covariance selection. To provide a synthetic benchmark in the absence of an experimentally validated gold-standard network, {SPIEC}-{EASI} is accompanied by a set of computational tools to generate {OTU} count data from a set of diverse underlying network topologies. {SPIEC}-{EASI} outperforms state-of-the-art methods to recover edges and network properties on synthetic data under a variety of scenarios. {SPIEC}-{EASI} also reproducibly predicts previously unknown microbial associations using data from the American Gut project.},

We assume that most aspects of the conditional dependence networks are shared, but that there are some structured differences between them. Rather than assuming that similarities and differences between networks are driven by individual edges, we take a node-based approach, which in many cases provides a more intuitive interpretation of the network differences. We consider estimation under two distinct assumptions: (1) differences between the K networks are due to individual nodes that are perturbed across conditions, or (2) similarities among the K networks are due to the presence of common hub nodes that are shared across all K networks. Using a row-column overlap norm penalty function, we formulate two convex optimization problems that correspond to these two assumptions. We solve these problems using an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm, and we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that allows us to decompose the problem into independent subproblems so that our algorithm can be scaled to high-dimensional settings.

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btab502},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Differential network analysis is an important tool to investigate the rewiring of gene interactions under different conditions. Several computational methods have been developed to estimate differential networks from gene expression data, but most of them do not consider that gene network rewiring may be driven by the differential expression of individual genes. New differential network analysis methods that simultaneously take account of the changes in gene interactions and changes in expression levels are needed.
{RESULTS}: In this paper, we propose a differential network analysis method that considers the differential expression of individual genes when identifying differential edges. First, two hypothesis test statistics are used to quantify changes in partial correlations between gene pairs and changes in expression levels for individual genes. Then, an optimization framework is proposed to combine the two test statistics so that the resulting differential network has a hierarchical property, where a differential edge can be considered only if at least one of the two involved genes is differentially expressed. Simulation results indicate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. We apply our method to identify the differential networks between the luminal A and basal-like subtypes of breast cancer and those between acute myeloid leukemia and normal samples. Hub nodes in the differential networks estimated by our method, including both differentially and non-differentially expressed genes, have important biological functions.

	abstract = {Modern high-dimensional point process data, especially those from neuroscience experiments, often involve observations from multiple conditions and/or experiments. Networks of interactions corresponding to these conditions are expected to share many edges, but also exhibit unique, condition-specific ones. However, the degree of similarity among the networks from different conditions is generally unknown. Existing approaches for multivariate point processes do not take these structures into account and do not provide inference for jointly estimated networks. To address these needs, we propose a joint estimation procedure for networks of high-dimensional point processes that incorporates easy-to-compute weights in order to data-adaptively encourage similarity between the estimated networks. We also propose a powerful hierarchical multiple testing procedure for edges of all estimated networks, which takes into account the data-driven similarity structure of the multi-experiment networks. Compared to conventional multiple testing procedures, our proposed procedure greatly reduces the number of tests and results in improved power, while tightly controlling the family-wise error rate. Unlike existing procedures, our method is also free of assumptions on dependency between tests, offers flexibility on p-values calculated along the hierarchy, and is robust to misspecification of the hierarchical structure. We verify our theoretical results via simulation studies and demonstrate the application of the proposed procedure using neuronal spike train data.},

	abstract = {It is often of interest to understand how the structure of a genetic network differs between two conditions. In this paper, each condition-specific network is modeled using the precision matrix of a multivariate normal random vector, and a method is proposed to directly estimate the difference of the precision matrices. In contrast to other approaches, such as separate or joint estimation of the individual matrices, direct estimation does not require those matrices to be sparse, and thus can allow the individual networks to contain hub nodes. Under the assumption that the true differential network is sparse, the direct estimator is shown to be consistent in support recovery and estimation. It is also shown to outperform existing methods in simulations, and its properties are illustrated on gene expression data from late-stage ovarian cancer patients.},

	abstract = {Gaussian graphical models capture dependence relationships between random variables through the pattern of nonzero elements in the corresponding inverse covariance matrices. To date, there has been a large body of literature on both computational methods and analytical results on the estimation of a single graphical model. However, in many application domains, one has to estimate several related graphical models, a problem that has also received attention in the literature. The available approaches usually assume that all graphical models are globally related. On the other hand, in many settings different relationships between subsets of the node sets exist between different graphical models. We develop methodology that jointly estimates multiple Gaussian graphical models, assuming that there exists prior information on how they are structurally related. For many applications, such information is available from external data sources. The proposed method consists of first applying neighborhood selection with a group lasso penalty to obtain edge sets of the graphs, and a maximum likelihood refit for estimating the nonzero entries in the inverse covariance matrices. We establish consistency of the proposed method for sparse high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models and examine its performance using simulation experiments. Applications to a climate data set and a breast cancer data set are also discussed.},

	abstract = {We consider joint estimation of multiple graphical models arising from heterogeneous and high-dimensional observations. Unlike most previous approaches which assume that the cluster structure is given in advance, an appealing feature of our method is to learn cluster structure while estimating heterogeneous graphical models. This is achieved via a high dimensional version of Expectation Conditional Maximization ({ECM}) algorithm (Meng and Rubin, 1993). A joint graphical lasso penalty is imposed on the conditional maximization step to extract both homogeneity and heterogeneity components across all clusters. Our algorithm is computationally efficient due to fast sparse learning routines and can be implemented without unsupervised learning knowledge. The superior performance of our method is demonstrated by extensive experiments and its application to a Glioblastoma cancer dataset reveals some new insights in understanding the Glioblastoma cancer. In theory, a non-asymptotic error bound is established for the output directly from our high dimensional {ECM} algorithm, and it consists of two quantities: statistical error (statistical accuracy) and optimization error (computational complexity). Such a result gives a theoretical guideline in terminating our {ECM} iterations.},

	abstract = {The Gaussian graphical model has been a popular tool for investigating the conditional dependency structure between random variables by estimating sparse precision matrices. The estimated precision matrices can be mapped into networks for visualization. However, the ability to investigate the conditional dependency structure when a two-level structure exists among the variables is still limited. Some variables are considered as higher-level variables while others are nested in these higher-level variables—the latter are called lower-level variables. For instance, genes are grouped into pathways for particular functions, so that pathways are the higher-level variables and genes within the pathways are the lower-level variables. Higher-level variables are not isolated; instead, they work together to accomplish certain tasks. Therefore, our main interest is to simultaneously explore conditional dependency structures among higher-level variables and among lower-level variables. Given two-level data from heterogeneous classes, we propose a method to jointly estimate the two-level Gaussian graphical models across multiple classes, so that common structures in terms of the two-level conditional dependency are shared during the estimation procedure, yet unique structures for each class are retained as well. Our proposed approach is achieved by first introducing higher-level variable factors within classes and then introducing common factors across classes. The performance of our approach is evaluated on several simulated networks. We also demonstrate the advantages of our approach using breast cancer patient data.
